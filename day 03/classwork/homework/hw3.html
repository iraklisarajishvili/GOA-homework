<p>mercedes CLS</p>


<p>The C257 CLS is the third-generation model and was previously available only as a four-door sedan and in rear-wheel or all-wheel drive (4MATIC) configuration.[17] The Shooting Brake body style was in development and the final design had been approved for the C257 CLS, but was discontinued prior to commencing production due to poor and declining demand overseas for the last generation 5-door estate.[18] The range of engines consist of a 2.9-litre straight six turbocharged diesel engine and a 3.0-litre straight six turbocharged petrol engine.[19] The latter equips the CLS 53 AMG with features such as a mild hybrid system and an Panamericana radiator grille, which pays tribute to 300 SL model.[20] The CLS is also now a five-seater car, instead of being a four-seater as with the previous two generations.[21]</p>
